# Fact-ory

The OpinionsAndFacts.ipynb file is a Jupyter notebook containing the machine learning algorithms that we ran on the dataset. 

The Ai4Good_pre.csv file is our dataset. It is already preprocessed. We manually collected the news articles (factual and opinion pieces) in it. 

The other files are used for the web application.
